A function f(x) is defined as the smallest fibonacci number greater than or equal to x. Ex : f(1)=1,f(5)=5,f(6)=8. The task is to calculate g(l,r)
where g(l,r) is defined as g(l,r) = f(l)+f(l+1)+f(l+2)+â€¦..+f(r).  Constraints: 1<=l<=r<=10^9. 

The idea is to first compute all the fibonacci numbers below 10^9 and the smallest fibonacci number greater than 10^9. There are hardly 46 such fibonacci numbers.
Now we can run a loop from l to r and check for the lower bound of  each number in between l to r. The catch is since r-l in the worst case is 10^9,
one will get a tle verdict if we simply find the lower bound for every number from l to r 
(Can you optimize this solution to pass all the test cases?).
