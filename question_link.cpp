//Reverse a stack without using any external data structure. Initially, I had no idea how to solve this problem.
//But the interviewer helped me by giving some hints and finally I was able to solve it.



//Find the merging point of two linked lists. I was told that no hints would be provided by the interviewer,
//but I knew the problem and I solved it quite easily.




//Then questions on Indexing in DBMS, Polymorphism, the difference between Process and Thread, Semaphores and Mutex.

//In an array of elements ( 1 <= a[i] <= n ), one element will be repeated. Find both the repeating and the missing elements.

//In an array of elements ( 1 <= a[i] <= n ) find the frequency of occurrence of numbers 1 to n without using any extra space (not even a hashmap). 
//I was about to quit this question, the interviewer gave me a hint and then I was able to solve it. He was telling me that I have missed an edge case,
//I didn’t get what was that edge case and he moved to the next question.

//Given a binary tree, for each node in the tree, replace the node value with the sum of its children subtrees.

//Next, he asked me to write a function for the tic tac toe game to check at a given point whether any of the players has won or the game is still going on. 
//I first wrote the brute force approach code but with the help of the interviewer, I optimized it.

//The next question was LCA of two nodes in a binary tree but he changed the tree structure.
 //Instead of left and right pointers for each node, he told me that each node will have a parent pointer pointing to the previous level parent node. 
 

// Function f(x) is defined as the smallest fibonacci number greater than or equal to x. The task is to calculate g(l,r)
//where g(l,r) is defined as g(l,r) = f(l)+f(l+1)+f(l+2)+…..+f(r).  Constraint: 1<=l<=r<=10^9.


//Given N coins and an array of costs that represents the cost of each digit (1,2,…9), where costs[i] is the cost of picking the digit i. 
//The task is to find the largest number that can be represented by using the N coins.
 


// This round also started with a basic introduction and some OS questions like he asked me to explain the deadlock phenomenon with the help of a real-life example. 
//Then he asked me about indexing in DBMS.


//In OS he asked,

Difference between process and thread.
Scheduling Algorithms.
Deadlocks.
Semaphore and Mutex.
Static and Dynamic Binding
Page fault and Demand Paging.
  
  
  
//In OOPs, he asked

Important features of OOps.
Diamond Problem in Multiple Inheritance.
Virtual Keyword.
//In DBMS, he asked

Normalization and its types.
Transactions.
ACID properties of DBMS.
//In CN, he asked :

Difference between TCP and UDP.
OSI Model.
